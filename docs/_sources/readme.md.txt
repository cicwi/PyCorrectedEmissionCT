Physically corrected projectors for X-ray induced emission CT.
PyCorrectedEmissionCT is usually abbreviated to its python module name: `corrct` (either pronounced "corr-C-T" or "correct").

This package provides the following functionality:

* Support for **attenuation correction** of the forward-projection and back-projection.
* Various solvers (reconstruction algorithms):
  - Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (**SIRT**).
  - Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (**SART**).
  - Primal-dual optimization from Chambolle-Pock (Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient - **PDHG**), with:
    * Various data fitting terms, including **Gaussian and Poisson noise** modelling.
    * Various optional regularization terms, including: **TV-min**, l1-min, laplacian, and **wavelet** l1-min.
    * Multi-channel (collaborative) regularization terms, like: **TNV** (Total Nuclear Variation).
  - Filtered Back-Projection (**FBP**), and its data-dependent filter learning variant
(**[PyMR-FBP](https://github.com/dmpelt/pymrfbp)**)
* Two projector backends: [astra-toolbox](https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox) and
[scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image).
* Guided **regularization parameter selection**, through cross-validation and elbow method.

It contains the code used for the following paper, which also provides a
mathematical description of the attenuation correction concepts and algorithms used here:

## Getting Started

It takes a few steps to setup PyCorrectedEmissionCT on your
machine. We recommend installing
[Anaconda package manager](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for
Python 3.

### Installing with conda

Simply install with:
```
conda install -c n-vigano corrct
```

If you want fast tomographic projectors using the astra-toolbox:
```
conda install -c astra-toolbox astra-toolbox
```

### Installing from PyPI

Simply install with:
```
pip install corrct
```

If you are on jupyter, and don't have the rights to install packages
system-wide (e.g. on jupyter-slurm at ESRF), then you can install with:
```
! pip install --user corrct
```

### Installing from source

To install PyCorrectedEmissionCT, simply clone this GitHub
project. Go to the cloned directory and run PIP installer:
```
git clone https://github.com/cicwi/PyCorrectedEmissionCT.git corrct
cd corrct
pip install -e .
```

### Running the examples

To learn more about the functionality of the package check out our
examples folder.
